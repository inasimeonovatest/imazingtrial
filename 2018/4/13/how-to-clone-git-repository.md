#  My First Git Cloning

When you're working on a project, chances are that you're going to have a bunch of different features and ideas going on at any given time.
This is where Git comes in handy and makes your life easier (if you're not allergic to technology and a little bit of geekiness, that is)
Today I was able to do my first cloning and I will walk you through the process.

## First things first - You'll have to create a repository first.

Creating a repository is the first thing you'll have to do. Simply click on the plus button on the top right (right next to your avatar) and select "New repository"

*Congratulations!* You have successfully created your first "repository".

That was easy, right? What follows now is to clone it (make a copy of it, in simple words)

##Go to SourceTree

SourceTree facilitates the usage of Git. You can download it [here](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

Here is how you can clone a file in a couple of easy steps:

* Go to "File" at the top left
* Click on "Clone/New". You will see this:

 * Now you need to go back to Git and copy the URL from there
 * Create a new **(empty!)** folder on your computer
 * Choose a name for the folder
 * Select "Clone"

 **Voila! You have cloned your first repository.**
